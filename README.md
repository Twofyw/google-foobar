# My Solution to my Google Foobar Challenge
I was invited to this challenge by searching "golang tail recursion" on Google.

A tip I see online is that don't rush into the challenge until you feel like you're as good as a Google developer, and I agree to this because of its hard deadlines.

Anyway, because the discussion on the internet has gained hundreds to thousands of views, with this many candidates, I suspect the challenge could simply be a marketing game at the end. 
I believe the probability of getting an interview by solving Google Foobar is almost as low as applying for a job online. 
So I'll just solve it with a mindset of practicing algorithmic problems just the same as playing with [Advent of code](https://github.com/Twofyw/advent-of-code-2019).

Here are my solutions.
